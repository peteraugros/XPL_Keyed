-- Adds new_trial_booked to derived_tasks_view as an AWARENESS card type.
--
-- Distinction from required tasks:
--   * Required tasks (trial_decision, new_student_welcome, etc.) demand
--     Tim's action. waiting_on='TIM' is the gate.
--   * Awareness cards are informational ("something just happened that
--     you should know about"). They drop off naturally when the
--     underlying state changes — Tim doesn't need to mark them done.
--
-- new_trial_booked fires during the window between parent booking the
-- free call and the call actually happening (30 min after start time).
-- After that 30 min, the existing trial_decision filter promotes the
-- subscription to a required task, and the awareness card naturally
-- disappears.
--
-- Priority: 40. Below messages (50/60), well below welcome (70) and
-- trial_decision (80). Sits at the top of the queue only when Tim has
-- nothing more urgent.
